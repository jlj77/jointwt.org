      your timeline not an algorithm. On Twt you own your content and since

          Not a technical person? No worries. The creators of this project
          also created Twt.social where you can start your own small community
          and join the larger Twt “social media” network with family, friends
          and like minded folks. We bring the tech, you bring the conversations.
