Getting started and joining the Twt.social network is easy! Simply follow these
simple steps:

 - Pick a pod you want to join.
 - Create an account on that pod.
 - And now just login!

For example you can join the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) pod by visiting
https://twtxt.net/register picking a username and password and then signing
in. Don't forget to provide an email address which is used to recover your
account in case you forget your password!

> __NOTE__: We don't actually store your email address at all! We store a hash
>           of it and use it only for password recovery. If you forget your
>           email address or loose access to it, your account is forfeit as we
>           __DO NOT__ store any Personal Identifable Information (PII) about
>           you as a Twt.social user. There is simply no way to prove that
>           anyone "owns" an account.

The same steps above apply to our [Mobile App](/goryon).

You can find other pods to join that [Twt.social](https://twt.social) hosts
