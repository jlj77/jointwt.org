Twt and thus all [Twt.social](https://twt.social)
pods (_that's what we call an individual server_) is _actually_ pretty similar
to Twitter™ so if you've used Twitter™ before you'll feel right at home!

You can:

 - Post little short-form posts we called "Twt"(s)
 - Follow other users throughout the Twt / Twtxt network
 - Tag and search for "twts" by #hashtag or @mention
 - Upload media, small photos and have them displayed inline with your "twts"

You can also update your profile, say a little about yourself, upload a mug
shot (_or if you don't we'll create an automated avatar for you!_).

**Unlike** Twitter™ however:

 - We **DO NOT** collect _any_ Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from
you whatsoever! In fact when you sign-up an Email address is completely option
(_just be sure you don't forget your password as we cannot recover accounts without a valid email address!_).
 - We **DO NOT** sell your data to 3rd-parties (_not even 2nd-parties_),
there is none to sell!  - We **DO NOT** have any advertising and our business
model is not based around it.

Most importantly of all Twt, Twtxt (_the foundation we built upon_)
and [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pods are designed from the ground up to
be decentralized. What does this mean for you? It simply means that there is
no single service or entity that underpins the general Twt / Twtxt "social
network". You are free to join _any_ Pod, whether it be a friend's Pod or the
one we run at [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net), run your own or purchase a
hosted fully-managed Pod from us. No single person or entity controls the
platform overall.

Additionally (_but subtly_) the platform and the software behind it does not
care about censorship or moderation. We believe users have the right,
the power and knowledge to follow who they want (_or not_) and grow their own
social interactions. Please see our [Abuse Policy](https://twt.social/abuse)
for more details.
